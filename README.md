# REP Fitness Tracker

I really wanted to get a bench but it would constantly get sold out before I could get to the site. Sooo.... I created this script to flash a notification on my mac when the rep fitness site changed.

Make sure you have Crystal 1.0 installed.

To build the project:

```
$ crystal build check.cr
...
$ ./check
```

Change the url in the script to the page of the thing you want to buy.
